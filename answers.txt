Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to economics. An example could be get data on what
kinds of items people are buying online and in-stores, and use that data to make
predictions about how the stock market could change or just to analyze what items are
in high or low demand at the time.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Both merging and rebasing combines two branches onto one.
My understanding is that merging takes the last state of both branches and combines them into one.
Whereas rebasing sequentially adds each commit from one branch onto the end of the other.
With rebase you could also ignore certain commits from one branch, which you cannot do with merge.
